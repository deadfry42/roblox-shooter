# roblox-shooter
A free-and-open-source Roblox shooter, developed primarily by me.

## Notes
this game was originally named 'siege-2'. You may see this codename throughout.

This Roblox game uses the Rojo build system; see [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) for more information.

## Building
To build, run this in the command line:

```bash
rojo build -o "roblox-shooter.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `roblox-shooter.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server ([Rojo plugin](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/13916111004/Rojo) required):

```bash
rojo serve
```

For more help, check out [the Rojo documentation](https://rojo.space/docs).
